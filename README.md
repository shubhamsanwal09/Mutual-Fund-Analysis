# Mutual Funds Dashboard

This repository contains my first data project â€” a Google Sheets dashboard built from scratch to analyze mutual fund performance, expense ratios, and growth metrics.

---

## Project Overview

This project was developed during my early learning phase while exploring the fundamentals of mutual fund research and data structuring.

The dashboard is based on manually collected data and focuses on three key areas:

- Fund performance snapshots
- Expense ratio comparisons
- Growth tracking over time

The entire dashboard was created using Google Sheets without any external plugins or advanced tools.

## Note on Portfolio Evolution

Since completing this dashboard, my understanding of mutual funds has significantly deepened.  
I have finalized a new long-term portfolio based on thorough analysis and conviction.

While the funds in this dashboard are no longer part of my current holdings, this project still represents my first real proof of execution and learning.
